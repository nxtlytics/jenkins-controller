jenkins:
  systemMessage: |
    Welcome to our build server.

    This Jenkins is 100% configured and managed 'as code'.
    Config is now mostly handled by the 'Jenkins Configuration as Code' (JCasC) plugin.
    JCasC config can be found in the /usr/share/jenkins/ref/casc_configs folder.

    Some settings are still injected from /usr/share/jenkins/ref/init.groovy.d/ scripts,
    but these settings will be ported over to JCasC as support becomes available.
    See https://github.com/nxtlytics/jenkins-master for more
